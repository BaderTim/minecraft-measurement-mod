The Minecraft Measurement Mod allows the terrain to be measured from the player's perspective. Various measuring devices, such as LiDAR sensors, can be simulated. The measurement data can be saved externally.

## Example
This example shows a LiDAR with a horizontal and vertical field of view of 60° 
and a resolution of 240x240 distance scans running at 1Hz.
